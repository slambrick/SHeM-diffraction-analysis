# SHeM-diffraction-analysis

Analysis for diffraction measured SHeM.

Contains a python class which is the basis of analysis for diffraction with SHeM. The class may be used to import, analyse and plot diffraction data gathered in the Cambridge A-SHeM - although with minor modification it should be usable for data gathered in other ways. It can also present simulated SHeM diffraction patterns generated with the [SHeM Ray Tracing Simulation](https://github.com/slambrick/SHeM-Ray-Tracing-Simulation).

## Data structure

The basis of the class is that a SHeM spot profile has been generated by taking multiple 'z scans' (or something similar) at many different azimuthal orientations of the surface. These z scans are imported and packaged into a data structure based around the following core matrices:
 - `z`: z position of the sample for that data point
 - `theta`: detection angle (can be calculated from `z`) for that data point
 - `alpha`: azimuthal orientation of the sample for that data point
 - `signal`: detected signal
 - `DK`: parallel momentum transfer
 - `kx`: parallel momentum transfer projected into a fixed direction on the surface
 - `ky`: parallel momentum transfer projected into a 2nd (perpendicular) direction on the surface.
